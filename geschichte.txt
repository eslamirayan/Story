When I was little I wanted to climb up a tree because I was very energetic and I wanted to move my body and wanted to be athletic. Anyways before I climbed up the tree me and my family went to the park near our to our apartment. I ran to a random tree which I wanted to climb up. I did my best to make it to the top of the tree but I didn't manage to reach it. As soon as I wanted to climp off, I slipped and fell on the ground. I didn't get hurt badly but I was traumatized and I think after that day I never climbed up a tree again.
